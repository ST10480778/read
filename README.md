## ðŸ§¾ Self-Evaluation Reflective Report (Draft)

### 1. **Introduction**
During the Work Integrated Learning (WIL) module, I had the opportunity to apply my foundational knowledge in mobile and web development to a real-world scenario. This experience allowed me to integrate technical skills with design thinking and teamwork, while also reflecting on my personal growth and professional development.

### 2. **My Role and Contributions**
In the early stages, I contributed an individual report outlining my ideal design for the Empowering the Nation web page and mobile app. I used **Figma** to create wireframes and mockups, focusing on intuitive navigation, responsive design, and accessibility. I also designed a logo that reflects the professionalism and purpose of the business.

During the group phase, my design was selected as the base, and I collaborated with my teammates to refine the UI and UX. I took the lead on implementing the mobile app using **Kotlin** and assisted with the React-based web interface. I ensured consistency in layout, color palette, and iconography across both platforms.

### 3. **Skills Developed**
- **Technical Skills**: I deepened my understanding of **Kotlin**, **React Native**, and responsive design principles. I also improved my ability to use **Figma components** and prototyping tools effectively.
- **Teamwork**: Working in a group helped me practice clear communication, task delegation, and conflict resolution.
- **Time Management**: Balancing milestones and deliverables taught me to prioritize tasks and meet deadlines consistently.

### 4. **Challenges and Solutions**
One challenge was aligning the mobile and web interfaces to ensure a seamless user experience. To solve this, I created a shared design system in Figma and held weekly syncs with my team to review progress. Another challenge was video editing for our final presentation, which I overcame by learning basic editing tools and coordinating remote recordings.

### 5. **Reflection and Growth**
This module helped me reflect on my strengths and areas for improvement. I realized the importance of **user-centered design** and how small detailsâ€”like button placement or font choiceâ€”can impact usability. I also became more confident in presenting my work, both visually and verbally.

### 6. **Employability Skills**
Through this experience, I developed key employability skills:
- **Problem-solving**: Tackling design and development issues with creative solutions.
- **Communication**: Explaining technical concepts to non-technical peers.
- **Professionalism**: Meeting deadlines, respecting team roles, and maintaining a positive attitude.
